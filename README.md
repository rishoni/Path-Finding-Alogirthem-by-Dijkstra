# Path-Finding-Alogirthem-by-Dijkstra -rishoni

Implement a human-computer interaction mode, where the following will be possible: a) Visualise the generated squared grid as depicted by figure 1; b) The user should be in a position to mark interactively the start and end cells for the shortest path finding algorithm. This could be done by either entering the coordinates (i, j) as positive integers for two arbitrary start and end points, A and B, respectively, or by clicking these cells with the cursor and mouse; c) Select from the three options of distance based metrics, i.e, Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, the one to apply for the shortest path finding algorithm.Design and implement your shortest path finding algorithm. Your implementation should switch over these three distance metrics and produce, for each one, as output: a) visualisation of the shortest path on the squared grid, b) the total cost of the shortest path depending on the applied distance metric.
